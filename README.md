## What is Fitbit Intraday Heart Rate Data?
Fitbit Trackers which have Heart Rate sensors in them capture the [Heart Rate **continuously**](https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1565#How). However, Fitbit's App provides the Heart Rate information in 5-minute intervals.

This code allows you to download the detailed data from Fitbit's website and either see it on a chart, or download it in an Excel.

## Why was this created?
I was quite emotionally charged up during a work seminar. Though I was sitting, I could feel my heart rate rising up. The Fitbit App was showing minimal heart rate increase, but I wanted to delve into more details. Since I could not find the detailed information easily available from the Fitbit App & Website, I used the Fitbit APIs to retrieve the data.
